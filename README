This is a starter kit for a simple web application.

It wires up a bunch of nice pieces:

  Jade templates for the static web page
  Stylus css
  ThirdParty JS getting copied into build js

  Web Server and Watcher for development through `grunt dev`

Notes:
  make sure to upgrade all the grunt packages, and also require.js in the thirdparty dir
